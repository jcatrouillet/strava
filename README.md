# Strava backup and statistics/analytics scripts

In 2022, Strava started to make the yearly statistics as part of the subscription.
I love statistics but I did not intend to pay for Strava subscription just for that.
So I created this set of scripts to get my own statistics, freely inspired by the Strava 2021 stastistics and [SmashRun](https://smashrun.com/).

There're three different Python scripts:
1) <b>strava2gsheets_fullsync.py</b>: Retrieve all activities from Strava API v3 and store them in Google Sheet
Be careful if you have a large number of activities in Strava as it imposes a rate-limit of 100 API calls per 15 minutes.
My script is looking for this limit but if you're doing other calls, it can get wrong.

2) <b>strava2gsheets_deltaupdate.py</b>: Retrieve activities not already stored in Google Sheet

To use the 2 scripts above, you will need to setup a Strava app, follow the steps [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/)

3) <b>strava_stats_gsheet.py</b>: Analyze the Google Sheet to generate yearly statistics like Strava used to give for free in the past
This script will produce two outputs:

  a) an image with your days of the year with activities (file named active_days_<year>.jpg) like this one:
![example of graph generated](https://github.com/jcatrouillet/strava/blob/main/active_days_2022.jpg)

  b) a console output that you can use to create your own presentation like [that](https://github.com/jcatrouillet/strava/blob/main/Strava%20stats%202022.odp). Here is a sample output:
